This script is a calcuator like my previous two projects with a key differnce. This calculator allows for multiple numbers and operations in a single caluclation (not folloing order of operations). I also implimented some error handling with reguard to user inputs. This required me to almost recreate the script entirely and work with loops extensivly. This was decently challenging as I had to figure out how to update a varrible multiple times throughout multiple loops and account for some unintended inputs. 

To run the script you need to enter a number which can be a decimal, the script will then ask for you to select an operator from a list. If you do not pick one from the list it will loop back until you do. NOTE: to end the calculation you must select the "=" operator. A user can have as many numbers and operator in a calculation as they want and they will be calcualted IN ORDER. Therefore no order of operations as stated in the warning on the script. Once the user is done and enters the "=" operator the script will provide the result and ask if the user would like to preform another calucation. If the user inputs "yes" or "Yes" then the script will loop, otherwise it will close. 

NOTE: the "%" operator is used as "mod" which will give the reminder of divison.
