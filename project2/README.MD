This is an addition to project 1. Project 1 is a calculator using java. The calculator prompts the user for numbers and then an operator and then preforms the 
calculation. The script then asks if the user is done to which if the user responds "yes" the program restarts and if there is anything else entered the script closes. 
Proejct 2 is an improved version allowing for the use of decimals when entering numbers. Project 2 also added the ability to use "ans" as a number to signifiy the 
previously calculated number (default 0).
